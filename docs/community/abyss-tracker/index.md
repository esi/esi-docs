# Abyss Tracker

![](abysstracker-logo.png)

The Abyss Tracker is a "killboard" for your Abyssal Deadspace runs - you can save your exact loot saved, aggregated and compared with others. You can also browse and share fits with other players.

The website is maintained by the team behind [EVE Workbench](https://eveworkbench.com).
