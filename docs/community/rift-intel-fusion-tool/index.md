## Map

The built-in live map shows the information you want, including current and past intel reports, and kills from killboards.
It's configurable, allowing to set up coloring, backgrounds cells, indicators, and info boxes to show any of tens of types of information.
It also shows the location of your characters, and has all the interactive features you'd expect.

## Planetary Industry

View all your colonies with real-time details.
Fast-forward to the future and see issues like storages getting full or production stopping before they happen and set up alerts for them.
Export all your data to a spreadsheet, if that's your thing.
