# ESI Scrapes

The ESI contains a lot of data, much of which takes a long time to fetch if you want all of it.
A number of ESI exports are available, maintained by third parties:

* [Fuzzwork Market API](https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/api/) contains regular scrapes of all market orders.
* [EVE Ref Data](https://everef.net/data) contains a number of ESI scrapes, including:
  * Game world data, which can be used to complement the SDE.
  * Market history past one year, where the ESI itself only provides a year.
  * Market orders.
  * Public contracts.
