# SDE Complements

The CCP provided SDE doesn't include all available game data. This is especially true for data related to newly added features. While some such missing data may be available through the ESI, a lot remains missing from both the SDE and ESI. This data may be obtained from third-parties, such as:

* [Hoboleaks Data Export](https://sde.hoboleaks.space/), which extracts data from the game client files.
* [EVE Ref's Reference Data](https://docs.everef.net/datasets/reference-data.html), which combines data from the SDE, ESI, and Hoboleaks together in one package.
