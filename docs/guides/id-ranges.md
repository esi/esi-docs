# ID Ranges

A lot of entities in EVE have a sequential identifier.
These identifiers are grouped into ranges based on the type of entity they represent.
This document lists the ranges and the entities they represent.

The ranges are inclusive, meaning that the first and last ID in the range are valid IDs, however (except ID 0), the first ID is generally not used.

Keep in mind it is not possible to tell if an ID is a character, as characters created before 2010-11-03 share ID ranges with other entities (corporations and alliances).
