""" Python 3 native (desktop/mobile) OAuth 2.0 example.

This example can be run from the command line and will show you how the
OAuth 2.0 flow should be handled if you are a web based application.

Prerequisites:
    * Create an SSO application at developers.eveonline.com with the scope
      "esi-characters.read_blueprints.v1" and the callback URL
      "https://localhost/callback/". Note: never use localhost as a callback
      in released applications.
    * Have a Python 3 environment available to you (possibly by using a
      virtual environment: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).
    * Run pip install -r requirements.txt with this directory as your root.

To run this example, make sure you have completed the prerequisites and then
run the following command from this directory as the root:

>>> python esi_oauth_native.py

then follow the prompts.
