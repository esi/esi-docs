# Third-party developer support

Aside from the [Dev Insights Blog](/blog), there are a number of other social and support resources available to you.

It is important to distinguish needing support for specific third-party applications, or for any of the services provided by CCP. If you need support for a third-party application, you should contact the developer of that application directly. If you need support for any of the services provided by CCP, we have resources available to you.

The official [EVE Online Discord](https://eveonline.com/discord) has a `#3rd-party-dev-and-esi` channel dedicated to third-party development. You can find both CCP members and third-party developers hanging out there.

ESI has its own issues repository at [esi-issues](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues). From there you can raise issues or ask for new features.

If you have been banned from ESI, responses to your requests will point you to the EVE Online support system. Please follow the instructions. Circumventing the ban can result in further action being taken, up to and including a permanent ban for all of your accounts.
