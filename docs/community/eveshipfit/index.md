# EVEShip.fit

EVEShip.fit is an online tool available on [https://eveship.fit](https://eveship.fit).
It allows you to view fits (via EFT or import one from in-game), create new fits, and share links to fits with others.

## Design goals

EVEShip.fit is designed with the following goals:

- Load quickly (< 500ms after first load), so it feels like a breeze to work with the tool.
- Mimic in-game where possible, to give an uniform look&feel.
- Make it easy to find better variants or to explore other designs.
- Keep data local in the browser (as in: do not send data to a server for processing).

Additionally, make it easy for others to reuse parts of this project, to embed it on their own website.

It is completely Open Source, and you can use it for your own project if you so like.
Either the calculation part for fits, the visualization, or both!
