# Community tools and Services

!!! info "Obligatory disclaimer"

    Please note that the tables below contains a list of projects that are not officially supported by CCP Games. We acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the developers who have created these projects and give them a soapbox to promote them. However, we do not endorse or guarantee the items listed below. If you have any questions or concerns about a service listed below, please contact the service creator directly.

# Libraries and Resources

These projects are intended for use as building blocks by other developers

{{ community_pages("resource") }}

# Submitting a Service or Resource

If you would like to list your service here, please submit a pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/esi/esi-docs), creating a sub-page in [this directory](https://github.com/esi/esi-docs/tree/main/docs/community) with more information about your service. Use the file in [`/docs/community/sample-service/`](https://github.com/esi/esi-docs/tree/main/docs/community/sample-service) as a template. The tables above will automatically update with the information you provide, assuming you follow the template.

## Resources vs. Services

The general rule of thumb is that if your project is something that a developer would use to build something else, it's a library or resource. If it's something that an end user would use directly, i.e. by installing it themselves, or through something already hosted, it's a tool or service.

## Requirements

1. Your service/resource must be directly related to EVE Online.
2. Your service/resource adheres to the [EVE Online Developer License Agreement](/license-agreement).
3. Your service/resource must be publicly accessible. :material-information-outline:{ title="No private services, please." }
4. The creator of the service/resource has an account in good standing. :material-information-outline:{ title="Yes, being banned counts as 'not in good standing'." }
5. Your service/resource is 'released', and not in an early alpha or beta state. :material-information-outline:{ title="We want to make sure that the service is stable and usable for the general EVE public. If you are working on a new project, drop by in Discord, as there's bound to be other developers there that might be interested in what you're tinkering with." }
6. (Bonus) Your service/resource is open source. :material-information-outline:{ title="This is not a requirement, but a nice-to-have." }

As always, we reserve the right to remove any service from this list at any time for any reason, or decline to add a service to this list.

!!! note "A note about search"

    You might have noticed the search exclusion marker in the template file.

    This part is required.

    While we want to keep a list of community services, the primary function of this documentation site is to provide access to information about the EVE Online third-party development ecosystem.
    Adding community services to the search index would dilute the search results and make it harder for developers to find the information they need.

    If a service is deemed to be of particular interest to the community, one of the documentation maintainers may choose to remove this exclusion.

## Adding images to your page

If you want to add images to your service page, be sure to add them to the same directory as your service page. Please keep the images small and optimized for the web, no larger than 250KB or 1024x768 pixels. Also try to limit the amount of images you use on a single page, preferably no more than 10 unless necessary.
