# Third Party Development Support and Social

Aside from the [third party developer blog](/blog), there are number of other social and support resources available to you.

Items marked with a :material-star: indicate that these are official CCP resources.

## Support

It is important to distinguish needing support for specific third party applications, or for any of the services provided by CCP. If you need support for a third party application, you should contact the developer of that application directly. If you need support for any of the services provided by CCP, we have a number of resources available to you.

### ESI :material-star:

ESI has its own issues repository at [esi-issues](https://github.com/esi/esi-issues). From there you can raise issues or ask for new features

### SSO :material-star:

The SSO has its own issues repository at [sso-issues](https://github.com/ccpgames/sso-issues). For operational issues, contacting the [EVE Support team](https://support.eveonline.com/) is the best way to raise those.

## Social

### :simple-discord: Discord :material-star:

The official [EVE Online discord](https://eveonline.com/discord) has a channel dedicated to third party development. You will find a number of third party developer hang out there as well.

### :simple-x: Twitter

EVE Online players have taken a liking to the [#TweetFleet](https://x.com/search?q=%23TweetFleet) hashtag, and you can often find third party developers using it as well.

### :simple-reddit: Reddit

Next to the normal [/r/eve](https://reddit.com/r/eve) subreddit, there is also a [/r/evetech](https://reddit.com/r/evetech) subreddit more aimed at third party development.
