# Guidelines

1. If you want to do something and have to ask "I know this is bad but maybe they will let me do it anyways." Just don't do it.
2. Provide a good User-Agent header. A good header includes some way for CCP to contact you, such as an ingame character name, e-mail address and / or Tweetfleet slack name. For your own benefit you may also want to include a way for yourself to identify which app sent the header.
