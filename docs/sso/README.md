# SSO

## What is the SSO
Single Sign On (SSO) services are a way for users to log into one web site using their username and password from a different web site. For example, any time you log into a website using your Facebook account you are interacting with Facebook's SSO.

In EVE Online's case, you can use their SSO to allow users of your application to authenticate against EVE's servers using a method called [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/). This means that your application will never deal with that user's username or password for EVE.

### Login Images
When creating a button to direct users to login to your site or application with the EVE SSO please use one of the following images for the button. This helps create consistency for EVE players amongst all third party applications when viewing your site or application.
